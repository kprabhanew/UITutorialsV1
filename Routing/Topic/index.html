    <p>A single-page application (SPA) is a web application or web site that fits on a single web page with the goal of providing a user experience similar to that of a desktop application. In an SPA, either all necessary code – HTML, JavaScript, and CSS
        – is retrieved with a single page load,[1] or the appropriate resources are dynamically loaded and added to the page as necessary, usually in response to user actions. The page does not reload at any point in the process, nor does control transfer
        to another page, although the location hash or the HTML5 History API can be used to provide the perception and navigability of separate logical pages in the application.[2] Interaction with the single page application often involves dynamic communication
        with the web server behind the scenes.</p>
    <h1>What is SPA (Single Page Application) :</h1>
    <p>Single-Page Applications (SPAs) are Web apps that load a single HTML page and dynamically update that page as the user interacts with the app. SPAs use AJAX and HTML5 to create fluid and responsive Web apps, without constant page reloads.</p>
    <p>We write single page application because we get more native app like experience. In now a days people don't want waste their time to redirect to one page to another page. And technology is smart enough to do stuff more easy and precise way.</p>
    <p>With <strong>SPA</strong> your page is loaded only once and after that you don't have to re-render your page means you don't need to render your all references for each and every page request.</p>
    <p>There are many popular javascript framework available for creating Single Page Application:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Angularjs</li>
        <li>React</li>
        <li>Ember</li>
        <li>Backbone</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In this article we are talking about angularjs, which is one of the best framework right now. </p>
    <strong>Advantage of Single Page Applications</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>No extra query to server download pages Like (aspx, php, jsp and more)</li>
        <li>It improves performance in many ways, Like single time load each and every HTML, CSS and JS.</li>
        <li>SPA Separates UI and data. Basically it communicate with server only with JSON REST API.</li>
        <li>SPA can using caching and local storage effectively.</li>
        <li>When you see SPA it look like a application rather then a web page.</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Routing in AngularJS</h1>
    <h4>AngularJS Routing Example – ngRoute, $routeProvider</h4>
    <p>Today we will look into AngularJS Routing example using ngRoute module and $routeProvider.</p>
    <p>Routing in AngularJS is one of the core feature.</p>
    <h3>ngRoute</h3>
    <p>AngularJS ngRoute module provides routing, deep linking services and directives for angular applications. We have to download <code>angular-route.js</code> script that contains the ngRoute module from <a title="AngularJS" href="https://angularjs.org/"
            rel="nofollow" target="_blank">AngularJS official website</a> to use the routing feature.</p>
    <p>You can also use the CDN in your application to include this file. In this tutorial, We are going to use the Google CDN.</p>
    <p><code>https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.2.28//angular-route.min.js</code></p>
    <p>If you are bundling this file into your application, then you can add it to your page with below code.</p>
    <pre>&lt;script src="angular-route.js"&gt;</pre>
    <p>If you want to include it from Google CDN, then use below code.</p>
    <pre>&lt;script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.2.28//angular-route.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</pre>
    <p>Then load the ngRoute module in your AngularJS application by adding it as a dependent module as shown below.</p>
    <pre>angular.module('appName', ['ngRoute']);</pre>
    <h3>ngView</h3>
    <p>ngView directive is used to display the HTML templates or views in the specified routes. Every time the current route changes, the included view changes with it according to the configuration of the $route service.</p>
    <h3>$routeProvider</h3>
    <p>$routeProvider is used to configure the routes. We use the ngRoute config() to configure the $routeProvider. The <code>config()</code> takes a function which takes the <code>$routeProvider</code> as parameter and the routing configuration goes inside
        the function.</p>
    <p>$routeProvider has a simple API, accepting either the <code>when()</code> or <code>otherwise()</code> method.</p>
    <h3>AngularJS Routing Syntax</h3>
    <p>The following syntax is used to configure the routes in AngularJS.</p>
    <pre>
        var app = angular.module("appName", ['ngRoute']);

        app.config(function($routeProvider) {
            $routeProvider
                .when('/view1', {
                    templateUrl: 'view1.html',
                    controller: 'FirstController'
                })
                .when('/view2', {
                    templateUrl: 'view2.html',
                    controller: 'SecondController'
                })
                .otherwise({
                    redirectTo: '/view1'
                });
        });
    </pre>
    <p><code>when()</code> method takes a <strong>path</strong>and a <strong>route</strong> as parameters.</p>
    <p><strong>path</strong> is a part of the URL after the # symbol.</p>
    <p><strong>route</strong> contains two properties - <code>templateUrl</code> and <code>controller</code>.</p>
    <p><strong>templateUrl</strong> property defines which HTML template AngularJS should load and display inside the div with the <code>ngView</code> directive.</p>
    <p><strong>controller</strong> property defines which controllers should be used with the HTML template.</p>
    <p>When the application is loaded, <strong>path</strong> is matched against the part of the URL after the # symbol. If no route paths matches the given URL the browser will be redirected to the path specified in the otherwise() function.</p>
    <p>When the application is loaded, <strong>path</strong> is matched against the part of the URL after the # symbol. If no route paths matches the given URL the browser will be redirected to the path specified in the otherwise() function.</p>
    <p>For example, if the URL is like http://www.google.com/index.html#/view1, The URL part after the # matches&nbsp;<code>/view1</code>, it will load <code>view1.html</code> page and if it matches&nbsp;<code>/view2</code> then it will load <code>view2.html</code>        in to the shell page. If nothing matches then it will go in otherwise condition and page will be redirected to <code>view1.html</code>.</p>
