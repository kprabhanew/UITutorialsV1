        <h3>1. Tracking changes on single elements</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                When you load an HTML template managed by AngularJS, all the input elements with an ng-model directive also have the ng-pristine CSS class associated to them.
            </li>
            <li>
                When the user modifies the content by typing into the control, the ng-pristine CSS class is removed from it and replaced by ng-dirty.
            </li>
            <li>
                It's important to keep in mind that the CSS styles are applied only if the control is associated to a model variable through the ng-model directive.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
            <li>
                In every input element we can also bind an handler function through the ng-change directive to listen to every change event.
            </li>
            <li>
                Every time the model variable is update as a consequence of a user interaction, the handler function is called.
                <ul>
                    <li>the handler is called only if the model variable changes as a consequence of a user interaction with the control and not if the variable changes because a new value has been assigned to it programmatically</li>
                    <li>the handler is called only if the model variable changes, this means that if the text in the input element is not valid (e.g. it's not a valid e-mail address in an input with type email), the handler will not be called until the text
                        becomes valid again so it can be assigned to the model variable</li>
                    <p>Note the difference between the text input and the email input. In the second one, the change handler is called only when the e-mail address typed in the control is considered valid.</p>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                It's important to keep in mind that the CSS styles are applied only if the control is associated to a model variable through the ng-model directive.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. Tracking changes in a form</h3>
        <p>how we can keep track of the global state of a form and how we can programmatically check the state of the single input elements through their parent form.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>To do this, we need to assign a name to the form and to all the input elements whose state needs to be accessed programmatically. </li>
            <li>As you can see, the state of the form can be accessed through the "testForm" variable that is automatically defined on the scope by AngularJS. </li>
            <!--<li> Any input element inside the form that has also an associated name, is made available for a programmatical access through the testForm variable, so if we need to access the state of formText, all we need to do in the code is write $scope.testForm.formText.
            </li>-->
            <li>The state of a single element can be decoded by reading the value of two variables: $pristine and $dirty. This is exactly what the getItemState function does in the example.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <form name="testForm">
            <label>Text: <input type="text" name="formText" ng-model="formTextValue" /></label>
            <strong>State:</strong> {{getItemState(testForm.formText)}}<br />
            <label>E-mail: <input type="email" name="formEmail" ng-model="formEmailValue" /></label>
            <strong>State:</strong> {{getItemState(testForm.formEmail)}}<br />
            <br />
            <strong>Form state:</strong> {{getItemState(testForm)}}
        </form>
